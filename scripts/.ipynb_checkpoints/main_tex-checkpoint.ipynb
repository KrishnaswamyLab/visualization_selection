    "Exploring high-dimensional data typically involves some form of dimensionality reduction to 2 or 3 dimenisons for visualization. The goal of this technique is to gain insight about the structure of the data, specifically the relationships between points. From these observations, one can generate hypotheses about the dataset. In this way, visualization is an important tool for narrowing the scope of investigation and aids in the selection of tools for future analysis. Thankfully, many visualization tools have been developed for high-dimensional data. However, along with a diversity of tools comes the corresponding biases and assumptions that these methods introduce.\n",

    "Take, for example, t-SNE. At the time of writing, [Visualizing Data using t-SNE (2008)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v9/vandermaaten08a.html) has over 8400 citations. In some fields, like computational biology, it's difficult to find papers without a t-SNE visualization. However, t-SNE has it's own set of biases, and these limitations are explored in the Distill article [How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/). Through a set of key examples, the authors show how parameter selection and intrinsic biases in the t-SNE algorithm can lead to misleading visualizations. This article has become a widely referenced teaching tool for the rational application of the method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we seek to take the question of *How to Use t-SNE Effectively* and go one step up: How can you select visualization tools effectively? How can you judge the results of each method? Which methods are best suited for different data modalities? The rest of this article will be divided into three sections. First, we will talk about different kinds of data structures and introduce a few toy datasets that we will use to compare different visualization methods. Next, we will use these datasets to discuss the algorithms behind seven popular dimenisonality reduction methods: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, PHATE, MDS, ISOMAP, and Diffusion Maps. We will then discuss sensitivity to parameter choices and methods for quanitfying the accuracy of a visualization method. Finally, we will apply our seven comparison methods to large, real-world datasets. The emphasis of this section will be how a particular visualiation tool biases the observer towards a set of conclusions about a given dataset."

    "Rigorous application of any computational technique starts with considering the desired application and how well a given method's biases fits that application. Generally, a good place to start is by creating *toy data*. A good toy data set is small, easy to understand intuitively, and has a clear heuristic for a sucessful visualzation. In *How to Use t-SNE Effectively*, the authors present several compelling toy datasets. Here, we will consider a few of these along with some extras: a graph, small collection of handwritten 7's, and [2000 pictures of Brendan Frey's face](https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data/frey_rawface.jpg)."

    "We selected these datasets because of the varying structures and modalites. The grid is uniform in the ambient space, the relative distances between the blobs is meaningful, the uneven circle is drawn from a regular, continuous manifold, but the data is sampled non-uniformly. The digits, graph, and collection of faces are non-typical data modalities for visualization but should have some kind of structure.\n",

    "For this blog, we wanted to focus on a mix of classic and popular algorithms. Not many people use PCA for rigorous visualization of high-dimensional data (looking at you, [population geneticists](https://blog.insito.me/why-pca-and-genetics-are-a-match-made-in-heaven-6042ea027cf0), but it is a common tool for preliminary analysis. Similarly, MDS, which is actually a collection of methods, is not as frequently applied for data analysis but serves as a foundation for non-linear dimensionality reduction. On the other hand, PHATE is an increasingly popular method for visualizing high dimensional data that we wanted to include because we developed it.\n"
